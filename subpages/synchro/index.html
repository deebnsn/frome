 				<h1 id="opener"> Eurozone business cycles have shown positive signs of synchronisation over the past few years, with some important exceptions. The usual suspects are not to blame. </h1>
 				<p>
 				Synchronised business cycles are vital for the Eurozone to function. The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt must set their lending rate at a level that suits all Eurozone countries. This would be difficult if they were all out of sync. A country overperforming in relation to everyone else would be a problem to the European Central Bank as well as a country underperforming. 	 
 				</p>
 				<p>
				If one country were in a boom period and their economy strengthening day by day, policy decisions by the ECB would affect this country differently to another country that is in a recession. Greece, for example, may benefit from low interest rates, to reduce the cost of their borrowing. Germany, on the other hand, may benefit from higher interest rates, reducing the chance of overheating their economy and causing inflation. Increasing interest rates would adversely affect Greece while benefiting Germany.
				</p>
				<p>
				 Using correlation as a measure of synchronisation we can determine patterns across the region. The Eurozone should naturally become more synchronised over time. Sharing a currency should remove barriers to trade and increase financial integration. Business cycles would become more aligned as their economies are effected by similar shocks. This can be see in the noughties. At the start of this decade, when the Euro was in its infancy, business cycles were generally not very synchronised. Synchronisation occured towards the end when the boom and bust of the global financial crisis effected all similarly. However, the Eurozone crisis that has been taking place since 2009 has brought about divergent patterns. Most notably in Greece and Portugal who have had to increase taxation and reduce public spending to repay massive debts. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In recent years, there have been more positive signs. Greece and Portugal have become increasingly in-sync with the rest of the Eurozone. France and Finland saw drops in synchronisation during the crisis but are at high levels now. Two countries of concern are Luxembourg and Austria. Austria’s synchronisation levels have been low for a long time, and do not follow the patterns of the other Eurozone countries. Luxembourg’s GDP is erratic and extremely out-of-sync with the rest of the Eurozone.  
				</p>
				<p>
				With these two exceptions, the eurozone appears to be in a period of relatively high synchronisation. This makes the job of the central bank easier and improves the effectiveness of policy to alleviate economic conditions. High synchronisation should not, however, be confused with good economic health of the overall region. Growth rates in the eurozone have stagnated for years. Italy is highly synchronised with this stagnation. It has seen many years of low growth and high unemployment. 
 				</p>
 				<p>
				With low growth but relatively high synchronisation across most of the Eurozone, the answer should be simple; the ECB should lower interest rates. This has already been done. The interest rate set by the ECB is currently at 0%. Quantitative Easing (buying bonds from financial institutions) has already been performed. Billions of Euros is being injected into the Eurozone money supply in the hope of increasing lending and boosting the economy.
 				</p>
 				<p>
				It appears that there is not much more the European Central Bank can do. The ECB alone cannot drag the Eurozone out of recession.
