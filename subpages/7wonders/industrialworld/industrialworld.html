				"The slowly evolving industrial revolution was the fertile ground that gave life to dreams in iron, cement, stone and steel. The pioneers of the age were practical visionaries, seeing beyond the immediate horizon, the safe and the known, as they cut a path to the future." - Deborah Cadbury, BBC.</p>

					<h2> Bell Rock Lighthouse</h2>
					<p> Robert Stevenson's Bell Rock Lighthouse was created off the east coast of Scotland between 1807 and 1811. The Bell Rock, is a large reef 11 miles out to sea, dangerously positioned in the approach to the Firth of Forth. In 1799, over 70 ships went down in a violent storm that raged along the coast. It is the oldest offshore lighthouse still standing anywhere in the world.  </p>

					<h2> Transcontinental Railroad </h2>
					<p> The First Transcontinental Railroad was a 1,907-mile contiguous railway line constructed between 1863 and 1869 that connected the existing eastern U.S. rail network at Council Bluffs, Iowa with the Pacific coast at San Francisco Bay. </p>

					<h2> Bazalgette's London sewers </h2>
					<p> Before Joseph Bazalgette, the Thames was little more than an open sewer.  Bazalgette's solution was to construct 82 miles of underground brick main sewers to intercept sewage outflows, and 1,100 miles of street sewers, to intercept the raw sewage which up until then flowed freely through the streets of London.</p>

					<h2> Brooklyn Bridge </h2>
					<p> Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City. Completed in 1883, it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. The bridge was initially designed by German immigrant John Augustus Roebling who died during it's construction. His son Washington Roebling continued with it's construction. </p>

					<h2> Panama Canal </h2>
					<p> The narrow land connecting North and South America was always recognised as a potentially excellent short-cut between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans - but it wasn't until 1881 that construction began. 44,000 workers spent 33 years hacking through mountains and redirecting rivers to complete the canal.

					<h2> SS Great Eastern </h2>
					<p> Brunel's 'Great Ship' was almost 700 feet long with revolutionary design. Brunel orginally faced considerable criticism: his ship was too big, it was too expensive, it would sink. "In fact, his concept became the blue print for ship design for years to come." - Deborah Cadbury </p>

					<h2> Hoover Dam </h2>
					<p> Hoover Dam, is a concrete dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River. It was constructed between 1931 and 1936 during the Great Depression and was the result of a massive effort involving thousands of workers, and cost over one hundred lives. The dam was controversially named after President Herbert Hoover.</p>
