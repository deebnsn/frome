		"I have set eyes on the wall of lofty Babylon on which is a road for chariots, and the statue of Zeus by the Alpheus, and the hanging gardens, and the Colossus of the Sun, and the huge labour of the high pyramids, and the vast tomb of Mausolus; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, 'Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand.'" - Antipator of Sidon, Greek Anthology IX.58.

					<h2> Hanging Gardens of Babylon </h2>
					<p> The Hanging Gardens were described as a remarkable feat of engineering: an ascending series of tiered gardens containing all manner of trees, shrubs, and vines. The gardens were said to have looked like a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World whose location has not been definitively established</p>

					<h2> Statue of Zeus </h2>
					<p> The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was a colossal statue completed by Phidias in 430BC. Zeus was seated on a throne, his flesh was of ivory, his drapery of gold. The throneback rose above his head. It was lost and destroyed during the 5th century AD. </p>
