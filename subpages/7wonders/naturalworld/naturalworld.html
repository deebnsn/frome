					<h2> Great Barrier Reef </h2>
					<p> The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. However, “The Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger. The twin perils brought by climate change – an increase in the temperature of the ocean and in its acidity – threaten its very existence. If they continue to rise at the present rate, the reefs will be gone within decades. And that would be a global catastrophe.” - David Attenborough </p>

					<h2> Mount Everest </h2>
					<p> The top of Mount Everest is the world's highest point above sea level. Many have attempted climbing it. Since the first climb of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, more than 2000 people have successfully climbed Mount Everest. Unfortunately, due to the hazards, over 200 have died attempting to climb it - making the death rate for Mount Everest climbers about 1 in 10. </p>
