 				<h1 class="opener"> #1 Jimmy Greaves</h1>
 				<p>
 				The most prolific goalscorer in the history of English top-flight football. Jimmy Greeves scored 357 league goals in total between 1957 and 1971. This included 124 for Chelsea, 220 for Tottenham, and 13 for West Ham. He had great acceleration and pace and was an excellent dribbler of the ball.

 				<h1 class="opener" id="opener2"> #2 Dixie Dean</h1>
 				<p>
 				An old fashioned centre forward. Between 1924 and 1938, Dixie Dean scored 310 league goals for Everton FC in the Top Division. He scored 60 goals in the 1927/28 season, a record that has never been beaten.

 				<h1 class="opener" id="opener2"> #3 Steve Bloomer</h1>
 				<p>
 				Considering that, up until 1906, there were fewer clubs and fewer games in the English Top Division, it is incredible that Steve Bloomer is still the third top league goalscorer of all time. From 1892 to 1914, he scored 309 top flight league goals for Derby and Middlesbrough. His specialty was a low and powerful shot, sent with speed and accuracy.

 				<p>
 				Gordon Hodgson scored 287 Goals for Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Leeds United in the League between 1925 and 1939. Hodgson was exceptionally strong but also had pace and control.

 				<h1 class="opener" id="opener2"> #5 Alan Shearer</h1>
 				<p>
 				Alan Shearer scored 283 league goals between 1987 and 2006 for Southampton, Blackburn, and Newcastle. This includes a record of 260 goals in the Premier League. A classic centre forward, Shearer used his strength and heading ability to become one of the most prolific goal scorers of all time.
